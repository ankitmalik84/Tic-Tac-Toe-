# Web Tic-Tac-Toe

Welcome to the repository for my Web Tic-Tac-Toe project! This is a simple implementation of the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as noughts and crosses, played in the web browser.

## Demo

You can play the game by visiting the [demo website](https://ankitmalik84.github.io/Tic-Tac-Toe-/).

## Features

- The game can be played by two players, taking turns to place their marks (X or O) on a 3x3 board.
- The first player to get three marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, wins the game.
- The winning player is notified with a beep sound.
- The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Getting Started

To get started with the game, simply clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Tic-Tac-Toe-.git
```

Once you have the code, you can run the game by opening the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Deployment

This project is deployed on GitHub Pages. To deploy your own version of the game, you can follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Update the `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` files as needed to customize the game.
3. Commit and push your changes to your forked repository.
4. Enable GitHub Pages for your forked repository by going to the **Settings** tab and selecting **Pages** from the left sidebar.
5. Choose the branch you want to deploy (usually the `main` branch) and click **Save**.
6. Your game should now be deployed and accessible at `https://ankitmalik84.github.io/Tic-Tac-Toe-/`.
