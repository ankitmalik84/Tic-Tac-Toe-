# Web Tic-Tac-Toe

Welcome to the repository containing the source code for my Web Tic-Tac-Toe project!

This project is a simple implementation of the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as noughts and crosses, played in the web browser. The game can be played by two players, taking turns to place their marks (X or O) on a 3x3 board. The first player to get three marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, wins the game. The winning player is notified with a beep sound.

## Getting Started

To get started with the game, simply clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/web-tic-tac-toe-.git
```

Once you have the code, you can run the game by opening the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Usage

The game is played on a 3x3 board, with the first player using X and the second player using O. Players take turns clicking on the squares they want to place their marks in.

For example, to place an X in the top-left square, the first player would click on that square. The game will then update the board and display it in the web browser, showing the current state of the game. Players continue to take turns until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.

If a player wins the game, a beep sound is played to notify the winning player.
